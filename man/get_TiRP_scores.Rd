\title{Calculate TiRP Scores}
\usage{
get_TiRP_scores(.data, .details = FALSE)
}
\arguments{
\item{.data}{A data frame (and/or a tibble). This is the input TCR sequence
data that will be used to calculate TiRP scores. The format must conform to
the following:
\describe{
\item{First Column}{A character vector of TRBV gene names}
\item{Second Column}{A character vector of IMGT JUNCTION sequences (CDR3
amino acid sequences from 2nd-CYS p104 to J-TRP/J-PHE p118)}
}
Column names are not important.

\code{.data} can alternativeley be a list containing multiple of such data
frames.}

\item{.details}{A logical. \code{FALSE} (the default) returns results as numeric
vectors of TiRP scores. \code{TRUE} returns results as data frames containing
all evaluated V genes and their CDR3 sequences, along with all
intermediary scores plus the final TiRP scores.}
}
\value{
A numeric vector of TiRP scores or a data frame of detailed results
for each evaluated unique sequence.
}
\description{
A scoring system to quantify TCR-intrinsic regulatory potential (TiRP)
}
\details{
A special note should be made to consider that this function, as written by
the authors, evaluates only sequences that are between 12 and 17 amino
acids in length and that evaluation is performed on sequences as they are,
in their linear, native states without first being adjusted for length by
IMGT unique numbering rules for JUNCTIONS. It was also discovered that the
original version of this function as written by the authors would fail to
produce "vgene scores", resulting in incorrect overall scores, if allele
identifiers were part of the V gene names. This was corrected in this
implementation of the calculation.
